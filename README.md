## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ - Welcome to my Repo

#### Most of my work is private and is not yet posted.  Starting with a few key tutorials / documents I typically share with others. 

- [**Evolution of AI Models: From Sequence Learning to Reasoning Transformers (2014â€“2025)**](./Evolution-of-AI-Models.md)
- [**In-Context Learning: A Quick Guide to Its Role in AI Growth**](./In-Contex-Learning-Intro.md)





PS: I generate my notes first via self written summaries, notes and thoughts - then optimizing them through an LLM for better flow and language.  So  all documents are  LLM enhanced. While I ask another model to fact check hte original doc and references, it could still hallucinate - so take it with a pinch of salt.
